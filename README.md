# VGC
VGC group 8's project: Students from different universities collaborate asynchronously on shared tasks using digital tools, accommodating various time zones. Optional live meetings via Zoom/Teams encouraged to strengthen international team communication.

I have created a Zoom Meeting and added everyone involved. You should only join this space if your team plans to meet online, and if you see multiple groups, you are all allowed to make your breakout rooms and communicate there.
